We are extremely pleased to announce that the Eclipse Vert.x version 3.9.0 has been released.

#### Core

`SameSite` Cookie policy has been added to the HTTP Server Cookies. This is also applicable to web which allows cookie sessions to use `SameSite` cookies:

```java
SessionHandler.create(store)
  .setCookieSameSite(CookieSameSite.STRICT);
```

SameSite cookies let servers require that a cookie shouldn't be sent with cross-site (where Site is defined by the registrable domain) requests, which provides some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks (CSRF).

#### SQL Client fluent queries

Todo

#### Redis client backport

For Vert.x 4.0 we are doing a full reboot to the redis client. The functionality for the new client is ready to test on the master branch. In order to give users the opportunity to test and make the upcoming client even better it has been backported to the 3.9.0 release. The new client will allow users to connect to a single node, sentinel or cluster of redis nodes. The easiest way to start is:

```java
Redis.createClient(
      vertx,
      new RedisOptions()
        .setConnectionString("redis://localhost:7006"))
      .send(Request.cmd(Command.PING), send -> {
        if (send.succeeded()) {
          // Should have received a pong...
        }
      });
```
