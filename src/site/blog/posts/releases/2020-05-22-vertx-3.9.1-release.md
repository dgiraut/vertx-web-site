We are extremely pleased to announce that the Eclipse Vert.x version 3.9.1 has been released.

Among all bug fixes you can find in 3.9.1 these enhancements:


#### SQL Client for DB2

Vert.x SQL Client now supports the DB2 database natively, this feature has been ported to Vert.x 3.9 in tech
preview

```java
DB2ConnectOptions connectOptions = new DB2ConnectOptions()
  .setPort(50000)
  .setHost("the-host")
  .setDatabase("the-db")
  .setUser("user")
  .setPassword("secret");

DB2Pool client = DB2Pool.pool(connectOptions);

client
  .query(sql)
  .execute(ar -> {
  if (ar.succeeded()) {
    RowSet<Row> result = ar.result();
    System.out.println("Got " + result.size() + " rows ");
  } else {
    System.out.println("Failure: " + ar.cause().getMessage());
  }
});
```

#### JDK 8 HTTP/2 support

Previously using the Jetty ALPN agent or netty-tcnative was required to use HTTP/2 on JDK 8.

TLS ALPN support has been back-ported to JDK 8 recently and Vert.x has been upgraded to support it which means now you
can have HTTP/2 on JDK 8 out of the box. You need to most recent version of OpenJDK 8 or Oracle JDK 8.
